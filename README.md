# Club etiquette :)

1. We'd like to see you on Zoom. Feel free to use a virtual background!
2. We may ask you to share your screen to show us your code - please be prepared to do this.
3. Use the "raise hand" reaction in Zoom if you have a question
4. Please try to keep your mic muted unless you are asking a question or have something you want to say to us. Also feel free to use the chat function in Zoom
5. Attend every class, because each one builds on the last. If you have to miss a class, please email us.
